# Acme books workshop

We have created a base app for you to get started with. You can view it on GitHub here: https://github.com/pendo-io/acme-books-workshop.

The app is using [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) which is a JavaScript framework.
> A JavaScript framework is like a blueprint that helps developers build websites or apps more easily. It provides a set of tools and rules that make it faster to write code and ensure everything works together smoothly. It's like having a guide that tells you how to organize your work and saves you time by handling common tasks automatically.

The app also has [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com) installed, which is a component library.
> A JavaScript component library is like a box of ready-made parts for building websites or apps, such as buttons, menus, and forms. Developers can pick these parts and put them together to create a polished and consistent design without needing to write everything from scratch.

The app has a dataset of books stored in JSON file.
> JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a format for organizing and storing data. It uses readable text to represent data objects with attributes and values, making it easy for computers to understand and exchange information. Think of it like a simplified language computers use to share and store information in a structured way.
