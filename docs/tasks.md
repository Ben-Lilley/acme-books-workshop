## 1. Clone and run the base app

To download a copy of the base app open your terminal and type the following.

```bash
# navigate using cd (change directory) to your documents
# optional: change the path if you want to save the app somewhere else
cd ~/Documents/

# clone the github repository
git clone TODO
```

This will clone the app into your Documents on your computer. Open the folder in your code editor.

To start the app run the following in your terminal.
```bash
npm run start
```

This will start a local development server on your laptop. You can visit your app in your browser by clicking or visiting the link provided by the output of that command. You should see a mostly blank webpage with the words `ACME Books Workshop`.
